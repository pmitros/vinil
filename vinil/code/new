I was wondering whether there was a possibility of us running our own server. 
There are a couple of reasons for this, but mostly because we have a deamon
running that is fairly processor-intensive and because it is Java-based and
would be much faster with a Java-based server like Jigsaw than a general-
purpose one that had to call Java through CGI (which requires forking off a 
new process and starting up a new copy of the Java bytecode interpreter on 
most servers). Also, we are planning to try our project in a classroom 
setting once the school year begins again, and we need to be certain it is
stable. Due to the number of experimental CGI programs on ThinkQuest's server,
it occasionally crashes, and cut easily be sabotaged by a student not wanting
to participate (for instance, last year's technical winner let users upload 
flat C source).

Thank you,
