The new pages look great. I would like to express my congratulations to 
Samidh on a job well done. 

Since the college page at The Rickoid Lounge seems to superceed the one I was 
maintaining, I am taking that down. 

A minor suggestion would be to try to keep more contrast between the letters
and the background, as the followed links are almost invisible on the main
page and the message board is pretty difficult to read. The way monitors
show colors varies between platfroms, so on some it may appear fine.

Note about colors for the technically minded: 
In display (and input) devices, there is very rarely a linear relation between
the input voltage and the amount of light emitted. Curiously enough, this
relationship is exponential in almost all input and output devices. The
exponent is called a gamma. Macintoshes and SGIs to hardware color correction
and have a gamma of 1.8. PCs and most other Unix boxes tend to have a gamma
of 2.2-2.5. For this reason, graphics made on a PC will look bleached on a
Macintosh or SGI and the contrast between lighter colors will be much smaller.
The reverse obviously also holds true. The PNG graphics format stores gamma
information and will hopefully replace gif and jpg within a few years. Gamma
can also differ between different monitors (and potentially graphics cards) on
the same card.
